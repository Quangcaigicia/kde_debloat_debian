KDEbloater or KDE debloater, removes bloatware from KDE Plasma automatically (made for Arch-based distros (needs pacman))

### how to use
download as zip
1. open terminal where you extracted the files
2. `sh kDEBLOATER.sh`
3. you might get asked for sudo permissions, press `y`

### VERY IMPORTANT
this script removes the bloatware of **my** preferences, **its very recommended to edit each `.txt` file so you select what you want or not uninstall.** <br>
adding / removing any software might **break** your desktop. be **careful**! <br>

**do not modify `fix_brokens.txt`. its very important in case your desktop stop working after the debloating task.**

**i also dont recommend running the script unless you know and really want to debloat KDE Plasma.**
